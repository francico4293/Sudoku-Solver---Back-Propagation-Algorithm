# Sudoku-Solver---Back-Propagation-Algorithm

This repository contains a Pygame implementation of Sudoku. The user interface provided can be used to solve any Sudoku puzzle provided by the user.
Although a preset board is provided when main.py is executed, the user can change the numbers in any square using their keyboard.

How to get started:
Download app.py, button.py, main.py, and settings.py into a common directory. Run main.py. Once main.py is executed, the Sudoku board will be displayed. At this point,
make any modifications to the board by selecting a square with your mouse and then entering a number with your keyboard. Once your puzzle has been successfully loaded,
click the solve puzzle button and wait for the algorithm to complete. Upon completion, you will see the solution to your entered puzzle.

Note to users:
The sudoku_solver.py file is a much cleaner implementation of the back propagation algorithm. This is being merged into the existing solution to yield faster puzzle
solutions.
